Pilot whales are classified into two species:

Long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas)
Short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus).
<p> The short-finned pilot whale was described, from skeletal materials only, by John Edward Gray in 1846. He presumed from the skeleton that the whale had a large beak. The long-finned pilot whale was first classified by Thomas Stewart Traill in 1809 as Delphinus melas.Its scientific name was eventually changed to Globicephala melaena. Since 1986, the specific name of the long-finned pilot whale was changed to its original form melas. Other species classifications have been proposed but only two have been accepted There exist geographic forms of short-finned pilot whales off the east coast of Japan, which comprise genetically isolated stocks.</p>
<p>Fossils of an extinct relative, Globicephala baereckeii, have been found in Pleistocene deposits in Florida. Another Globicephala dolphin was discovered in Pliocene strata in Tuscany, Italy, and was named G. etruriae.The pilot whales were also close relatives of the extinct blunt-snouted dolphin. Close living relatives of the pilot whales are the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and Risso's dolphin.</p>
<p>Evolution of Tappanaga, the endemic, larger form of short-finned pilots found in northern Japan, with similar characteristics to the whales found along Vancouver Island and northern USA coasts, have been indicated that the geniture of this form could be caused by the extinction of long-finned pilots in north Pacific in the 12th century where Magondou, the smaller, southern type possibly filled the former niches of long-finned pilots, adapting and colonizing into colder waters. Some claims that the Tappanaga, alternatively called Shiogondou, are not adapted form of short-finned pilots but a distinctive species of their own. Today, Tappanaga and Magondou differentiate their respective distributions by the border at around the oceanic front off Ch≈çshi, Chiba.</p>
<p>The animals were named "pilot whales" because pods were believed to be "piloted" by a leader. They are also called "pothead whales" and "blackfish". The genus name is a combination of the Latin words globus ("round ball" or "globe") and kephale ("head"). Melas is Greek for "black" and macrorhynchus comes from the Greek words macro ("enlarged") and rhynchus ("snout" or "beak").</p>
